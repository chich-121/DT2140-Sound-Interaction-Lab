        <b>Hunter</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Use Case Scenario:</b>
        You are a Hunter exploring a dangerous world. Suddenly, a monster appears in front of you. You grip your phone like a weapon and swing it forcefully to launch an electronic attack against the creature.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Connection:</b>
        The physical motion of swinging your phone mimics the action of striking or firing a weapon in the game. A strong swing results in a powerful electronic blast, creating a direct link between your real-world movement and the in-game attack.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Motivation:</b>
        By connecting the player’s physical motion with the sound of an energy attack, the interaction becomes more immersive and engaging. Swinging harder creates a stronger sense of impact, making the experience feel dynamic, intuitive, and exciting.
        <br /><br />

        <b>How to use:</b>
        Hold your phone like a weapon and swing it sharply to fire an electronic shot at the monster. The stronger your swing, the more powerful the attack will feel.
